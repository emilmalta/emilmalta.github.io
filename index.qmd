## Hi,

I'm Emil. I work with data (mostly healthcare and demographics), turning tangled data into tools and visuals people can actually use.

I like creative problem-solving, data storytelling, and learning new things. Outside of work, I'm either chasing my kids, or exploring new ideas and tools.

-   Collaboration with interdisciplinary teams. Focus on environmental impact of procurement and logistics.

**Statistics Officer (AC)**\
*Statistics Greenland (Nuuk, 2018 - 2021)*

-   Statistical programming and maintenance of official national registers.

## Education

**M.Sc. Bioinformatics**\
*Aarhus University (2016 - 2018)*

-   Statistical modeling and data analysis.

-   Focus on application in forensics - e.g. statistical mass spectrometry analysis of fingerprint residue, using regression and classification trees.
